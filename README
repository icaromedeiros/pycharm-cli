Using
-----

You can define ``PYCHARM_BIN`` as a env variable or set it in the script.

In MacOS PyCharm "binary" is in /path/to/PyCharm.app/Contents/MacOS/pycharm

Open PyCharm in current directory
```shell
./pycharm.sh
```

Open PyCharm in defined directory (full or relative path)
```shell
./pycharm.sh my_project
```

Tests
-----

Tested only in Mavericks with PyCharm CE 3.4 (works on my machine).

Fork it and improve it for other envs :)

Note
----

I am a not a fluent shell scriptER
